# ghibli-app

<p> This is an implementation of the 'Connect to an API with JS' tutorial from <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania Rascia</a></p>

<p>The tutorial app was extended as follows:<p>
<ul>
  <li>define a film class to create objects</li>
  <li>present additional details for each film (RT score, release date)</li>
  <li>use template literals to render content</li>
</ul>
